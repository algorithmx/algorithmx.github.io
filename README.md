# w3c compliance continuous integration
Travis CI builds the static website with Jekyll and uses
[validate.rb](validate.rb) to check content for w3c compliance.
Simon Sigurdhsson wrote the
[original validate.rb script](https://github.com/urdh/blog/blob/gh-pages/validate.rb),

and the modifications here are also available in the public domain
