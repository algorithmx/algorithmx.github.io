Some thoughts on the Quantum Processing Unit
===

I am a programmer and researcher working in the semiconductor industry. 
This article is a collection of my thoughts on the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU).

## How did we come to CPU

Technology boomed after the WWII. The most significant development was the transistor. Whtin 10 years of its invention, the point-contact transistor had evolved into a sophisticated MOSFET structure. The total cost of ownership of a computer drops significantly and became affordable to government agencies and private companies. At the same time, under the pressure of maintaining several non-compatible compute machines, IBM started to probe new paradigm of designing computers in early 1960s, eventually led to the CISC instruction set and the extremely successful commercial product System/360.

Modern CPU was born at the time when a set of instructions, or a program, can be executed on upgraded machines. The separation of program and machine is a natrual consequence of some "least action principle", where repeated labor should be avoided or be replaced by machines.  

## New trends: XPU

Until recently, CPU continues to evolve by the Moore's law. The number of transistors in an integrated circuit per unit area has been increased from few hundreds to 100 million per square millimeter. Computational tasks becomes more specific to data types and the demands on processors starts to diverge. The most significant example is the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), which was firstly designed for specialized tasks of computer graphics, but later on has been exploited by totally uncorrelated applications, such as scientific computing, artificial intellegence and cryptography. The recent architecture design of GPU has been heavily influenced by these demands.

Perhaps being inspired by the success of GPU from NVidia, and also being driven by the altimate goal of computational efficiency, many technology companies have invested on specialized processors. Nowadays, we see the tensor processing unit (TPU) from Google; the neural processing unit (NPU), such as the Qualcomm's Hexagon and Huawei's Ascend; the recently commercialized language processing unit (LPU) by Groq. 



## State of quantum computing

If we use the history of modern computers as a gauge, the quantum computer is in the stage of 1960s. 


## Programming language for quantum computer

It is not necessary for quantum  to follow closely the development of classical computers.
