                            <p>A typical simulation project can be modelled as a chain of steps, where each step is
                                a call to a particular simulation tool. Usually the project contains many simulations 
                                with different parameter configurations. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I have been using Sentaurus Workbench (SWB) for TCAD simulations. I found that the workflow managed 
                                by the SWB is convenient in some sense but cumbersome in many situations. So I want to develop 
                                my own tool to manage the simulation projects.

                                I found this contest valuable because the related training course and the starter package of contest problems

                            <p>The ion implantation is a frequently used process in semiconductor device fabrication.
                                Dopants are implanted into the desired regions of a semiconductor wafer to alter the 
                                electrical properties. The process is usually simulated by tracing the trajectory of
                                the ion inside the crystalline or amorphous material. Along the trajectory, the energy
                                exchange between the ion and the material is recorded for analysis of damage on the 
                                material. The ion stops when it loses all its energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>The fastest simulation uses the Binary Collision Approximation, where an ion hops from 
                                consecutive collision events. In this approximation, the trajectory is approximated by
                                zigzag lines. Various details must be considered in a consistant manner to produce 
                                realistic simulation results.

                                skkrmions in a ferromagnet, which is modelled by a lattice of magnetization vectors

                            <p>One crucial point in writing the discrete LLG equation is to make sure the magnetization 
                                vectors are normalized at each time step. This is common in all dynamical simulations of
                                system with constraints. For magnetization, the constraint is that its amplitude is constant. 
                                The naive way of "update and project" will not work. The correct way is to work in a local, 
                                intrinsic coordinate system.

                                a Eulerian perspective of the system into which the particles diffuse, so that the states are the 
                                site occupations in each unit cell and the reaction rules are determined by the motion of the diffusants.

                            <p>This project is to solve a problem of assembly L-shaped wires on a board. The wires are attached 
                                vertically on the board at approximately equidistant contact points. Once attached, a wire can rotate
                                along the x-axis. There are constraints on the smallest distance between any pair of wires. 
                                The goal is to find an overall configuration that satisfies the constraints and minimizes the total 
                                spreading angle of the wires.
