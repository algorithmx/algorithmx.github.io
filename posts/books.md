# Fizika by Holics László

Holics László is a Hungarian physics educator. His textbook **Fizika** has been introduced to China in around 2000. The (translated version) book influenced me a lot. In particular, the clear geometric description of the physics concept has later become a must-have before I explain any physics. **Fisika** has made significant advancements in classical and modern physics with elementary mathematics. Compared to Feynman's lectures, **Fisika** is more analytical, where most concepts are grounded to calculations. 

[Here is the original version of the book.](./posts/Fizika.pdf)

I am working on a project to translate the entire textbook into both English, Chinese and Japanese with AI. Here is the plan:
  - [x] Use MinerU (fork [MinerU-LANG]()) to extract the images and Hugarian texts.
  - [ ] Use LLM to translate the texts into English and then Chinese, Japanese. This step is done programmatically and other languages can be added.
  - [ ] Generate LaTex source code of the translated book.

It is widely accepted that most Chinese students are easily irritated and easily offended. [This book](./posts/中国人的思维危机.pdf) explains why. Try throw it to ChatGPT and see what it will say.
