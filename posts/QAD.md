Quantum Algorithm Design: Vision and Core
===

This is a working note to the related works published by [Classiq](https://www.classiq.io/). 
Hopefully I am able to answer the following questions:
  - What do we have for quantum computers now?
  - Why do we need quantum algorithm?
  - How do we build a quantum algorithm?
