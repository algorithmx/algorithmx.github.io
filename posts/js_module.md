===

Date : 2024-10-03


Modules have been causing headahe for a while since I started learning Typescript. 
I want to record the solution of module-related problems and solutions in this article for my own reference.

According to Section 26 in Frisbie (2020), the history of modules in JavaScript can be divided into two stages, namely the CommonJS/AMD stage and ECMAScript6 (ES6) stage. To understand CommonJS/AMD, see [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/commonjs-vs-es-modules-node-js).
