This is the final project for the Coursera course [JavaScript Programming Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript-programming-essentials/). The requirements is described [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-JS0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/M5_L1_Final_Project.md.html). I like this course a lot and enjoy making the website. Hope you like my work!
